I'm a huge fan of the open-source community and I have self-hosted my own movie, photo and cloud server on a VPS. Here's a self-hosted photo album from the trek - [Andharban Valley](https://photos.vedang.dev/share/WZ5HJIO4) which I recently visited, and here's my [Self-hosted Resume](https://resume.vedang.dev/).
